          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks Income</h2>
          <p>One of the leading health risks in the country is the obesity level in the population. Correlations have been 
            found between obesity and heart disease, the potential for developing diabetes and decreased longevity. In this 
            study, the correlation between poverty levels of states and their obesity levels was put under evaluation.
          </p>

          <p>Obesity levels range per state between about 20% and 35% of the poplulation. Poverty levels per state range 
            between about 10% and 20% of the poplulation.</p>

          <p>The correlation found between the two factors was an increasing linear relationship between the obesity levels
            of a state and their poverty levels. This means that, the poorer the state, the higher their levels of obesity were.
            This can be explained by lack of resources available to empower the population to live a healthy lifestyle. Other factors
            might include the lack of resources for the people to nourish themselves in a healthy and nutritious way. Lack of physical
            activity may also play a role, since the levels of depression (and resulting low levels of activity) have been shown to be 
            higher in the poorer population.</p>
